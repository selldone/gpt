# GPT
The GPT open-source project by Selldone offers scripts and documentation for implementing GPT for [**Open AI Store**](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts), facilitating its integration and utilization in various applications.


## Schema.json
The schema.json file contains the structure of the GPT data. This file is used to validate the data and to generate the GPT data entry form. The schema.json file is a JSON file that contains the following fields:

# Configuring Your GPT with OpenAI

Welcome to the future of business technology! OpenAI is launching its groundbreaking service, and you're invited to create your very own GPT for your business. Whether you're a developer, entrepreneur, or tech enthusiast, this guide will help you set up your GPT with ease. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Create a New GPT

Begin by setting up your new GPT:

- Navigate to your ChatGPT and click on your profile picture.
- Select 'My GPTs'.
- At the top of the page, click on 'Create new GPT'.

![create-GPT-step1.jpg](_docs%2Fcreate-GPT-step1.jpg)
**Note**: If you encounter any issues while uploading an image for your icon, consider using DALLÂ·E to create a custom image. Alternatively, drag and drop your file on the 'Create' tab and write: "set it as my GPT icon".

## Step 2: Personalize Your GPT

It's time to give your GPT its unique identity:

- Go to the 'Configuration' tab.
- Fill out the details about your GPT. You can use the 'Create' tab to assist you in this process.
- Think of this step as infusing your GPT with a touch of your personality or business essence.

## Step 3: Feed Your GPT Extra Information

Enhance your GPT's knowledge:

- You can upload various files like Excel, CSV (preferred), text, JSON, or other formats to provide additional data.
- Use the '[ ... ]' format in the prompt/answer to maintain clarity and organization.

## Step 4: Connect Your GPT to Your Servers or 3rd Party Services & APIs

Integrate your GPT with your existing tech infrastructure:

- For instance, to connect to Selldone, use OAuth for secure and restricted access.
- Define API calls and follow a standard structure. Don't worry; it's more straightforward than it seems!

**Finding Your Callback URL**

- The callback URL can be found on the previous page or by logging into your GPT and checking the requested URL there.
- Remember, changing the OAuth configuration in ChatGPT will also change the callback URL.

**Setting Up OAuth on Your Server**

- If using Laravel, enable 'Passport' and run `php artisan passport:client` to create a client.
- Most back-end frameworks provide official solutions for OAuth implementation.
